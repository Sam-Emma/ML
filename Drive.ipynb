I'm trying to anticipate after the black car is probably where he's going to move. And this is another one coming, he's beginning to move now. Now the bus is going to get going but the bus may let the green vehicle out. I didn't overtake because I could say that there was a cor positioned to turn right. If I tried to go around the bus, I'd have been straight into the back of a vehicle that was already there. Now I can overtake because there's no blockages on my side. Moving back in, I've got choice lanes one or two, I'm probably going to go lane one because there's no great advantage to being an either. And this is a natural default position. Red light here. And the reason I'll go for natural defaults to the left lane apart from that the way the highway case says but this mirror is always going to be more in my vision than that one. So if I've got the majority of vehicles passing on this side, it's easier for me to monitor without being distracted, whereas I've got it, I've got to work a little harder to use my left door mirror. Moving off checking both door mirrors. Watching the vehicles move in why is his choice to move, he wants to take that position the blue cars beginning to drop behind me. So that was very easy to monitor in that mirror of being in left hand lane. We're now back to 20 zone. So just keeping a check on the speed. We have got some diversions in version thing that's going to worry me. We have got one vehicle approaching silvercar behind I can't see him coming around. So I had to stop because they would have priority from the right, letting it roll in and move. It's going to give me a smoother move off. If I didn't stop the car coming from the right. I might have got in front of him. But he probably would have had to brake. And then I'd have been getting altercation with somebody. So it was just recognising the priority. The white van's going to move out I've got priority over the roundabout even though the creeping forward. And this within the highway code. It never gives you right of way, which is a huge misconception for a lot of drivers. And it states that quite clearly never gives you right away. But what it does give you is priority. Okay, so I have to recognise those priorities nice and early to understand whether I'm likely to have to give away to someone or not. And our code also says you should always give way if it's going to prevent an accident. So it's very clear on that it's just not read at all or not understood for what it is. So here I've got blockage on both sides. I've got to make a decision in the red car. I took it slowly so the red car had chance to avoid a little bit. We both didn't neither of us had priority there. So we had to sorted out between ourselves. The bus now is indicating in the brake lights haven't come on. So I've got a chance to overtake. We've gone to 30 now just past the hospital.\",\n",

So I'm going to stay off the gas, nothing behind me. So they're not expecting me to accelerate away. Lane 2 is the easiest path to come around that junction because everyone was stacking in lane two and throny. By coming into lane one, I actually had a much easier way around. And again, I'm coming back to this principle, my mirror is much easier to work out what the other cars are doing. If I'm a sandwich, I've got to be monitoring both sides and oncoming traffic. So I'm trying to drop my workload to make it safer and easier for myself. Moving on vehicles picking speeds picking up now we're in a nice free flowing road, that's a much better chance to decide actually, if they're not keeping up with the speed and I can overtake these vehicles, or if I want better vision or if it's getting punched. But you can see that because people tend to think slow, medium and fast. Rather than just lane One, two and three. They move there to go faster and then they get stuck behind the vehicles. We're all more or less travelling the same speed but I've got much more braking space than I have. I came off so much when that car turn left because he's a big vehicle and he's top heavy, he's going to have more wallowing as he takes a sharp turn. So he needs to slow down more to make that junction so different vehicles will turn at different speeds. Little sports car will pretty much stay on the same speed. Lower central balance we can even feel it in this car sometimes as we go around it's just leaning over a little bit I suppose it's time to check moving on. So green lights up had been green for a while. And this one I know we've got this little double junction so we've got some peering in and now I'm just waiting to see if that car is going to suddenly Chuck a signal on slow hard and turn into there to go from running into the car straight in front of us. I can see the red light up ahead so I'm anticipating the brakes from nothing on my lane too so if I can see that there's an easy lane to move into I can the white vans gonna move into that options now close to me.\",\n",

So what's the limit of your vision, and that's where you want to be focusing scanning as far ahead as possible. So I'm looking at the up ramp onto the motorway. That all seems to be nice and clear. So by the time we get there, I know we're fine. But then I'm bringing my vision in again and pushing it as far out again. And I'm probably almost paying, paying almost as much attention to what's going on behind me. Oncoming vehicles, I'm not going to have to deal with five to 10 seconds, the car behind me could be following me for 15 minutes. Had a time to safely stop there. And because of the distance and the vehicle we had behind, it was a sensible decision. If you've been really close to me, I might push through the light just like the van because I've got to allow for his stopping.  Van's cut straight across in front of me. And the VW  behind me is thinking of doing the same thing. Now he's gonna strive. Pick up speed a little bit. So to default to the left lane.\",\n",

But the longer I'm staying and more parallel and coming with it, the more that mirror is effective, you can do a blind spot check as well. We don't teach turning looking over anymore used to be taught that way. That mirror see flashes. Yeah, you've got that. But again, also within coming in, it's only until you got the right angle that the detector is picking up the right sort of information. And the problem with the blind spot check is because you're rotating you're late, you're taking folks off vehicles in front, if they start breaking, you could potentially stay on a motorway be accelerating into it.  Here again, push the vision down, we can see where everything's go, I can see from the street lighting that it's the striped bass then bending down to the left. So that's giving me a good line of where the road is going to be going. Same with you could do in the countryside with tree lines as well. Now we've got vehicles merging up. So we've certainly got a couple coming in. They've got their own lane, but I'm just watching for them to be moving across into my lane. The van didn't wait for me to go ahead because he's got his own lane. He doesn't have to merge into me on this one. And then I would like to get back into that lane one but I can let a lot of this traffic just sort itself out. Now it's a safe time to do it. And I'm not being impeded by anything up in front. I've got a vehicle trying to move out. One slowing he's going to use that now I've lifted off all the way through here because he may not pick up speed that quickly. And I'm waiting to see him moving away from me before I get back on the acceleration. Getting behind the truck lights and going green so I can just gently roll in. There's less traffic here, So again, it just gives me that nice gentle flow through. I've noticed the number plate on the vehicle in front. So it's not a UK plate Polish plate. So driver sat on the other side. So I've got to think about if I'm overtaking his blind spots and they are different. So I'm going to bring the speed up a little bit get ahead of the Luton and we're going to move across into lane two So particularly roads like the M25, and so on, you will get a lot of foreign vehicles coming off the ferries coming off the channel. So you've got to think about how you're positioning yourself in a mirror so they can see you. Particularly if they're trying to change their lane. I stopped because the bad drivers you say are very, very limited in their vision on those mirrors. It's not a fantastic system when you've got a big vehicle. Okay, I'm gonna move back into lane one.

These vehicles here, I'm just now opening up a little bit of space between me and the taxi, to give them to somewhere to slot in if they need to, if they're going straight on, so that wasn't required. So in dry weather, my ideal separation distance is about two seconds. If I know this vehicles moving in, then if I create a four second gap, they can slot in and everyone's automatically about their two seconds. Simply if I've got a vehicle that is driving very tight behind me to give him his two second cat, I will drop back for seconds to the vehicle in front. Now I can take twice as long on my braking, if I need to come to a quick stop, which allows him it's time I'm gonna move across the lane because these guys are just beginning to be a little bit slow for me. And I think it might be a little bit more progress in this line with the bands maybe in France. So you can see now this three cars are witt not really good separation distance. If that blue car front has to slam on the brakes, we've got two cars piling into each other, but I've got enough distance hopefully to stop and not be in it.
