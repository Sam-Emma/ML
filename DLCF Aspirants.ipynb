Temperature is a property of a system while heat is just a means of transferring energy.\\n9/29/20, 7:32 PM - Prosper Ubong: 🙇🙇🙇\\n9/29/20, 7:33 PM - +234 706 291 3214: <Media omitted>\\n9/29/20, 7:34 PM - +234 701 795 5647: 🎯\\n9/29/20, 7:36 PM - +234 812 387 4992: <Media omitted>\\n9/29/20, 7:36 PM - Prosper Ubong: I see we give our definition of heat as a form of energy ❌\\n\\n*Heat is a means of transfer of energy between two systems* \\n\\nHeat is a verb not a noun (dictionary)🧐🧐\\n So to say that heat  is a form energy, physicist don\\'t take it.\\nU can tell someone to heat water for you 💯💯 but you can\\'t say energy that water for me🙄🙄\\nIf heat were a form of energy we could replace heat with energy in the sentence.\\n\\n*Heat means energy transfer*\\n\\nI hope we understand\\n9/29/20, 7:38 PM - +234 701 742 5997: Yes sir\\U0001f9ce🏾\\u200d♂️\\U0001f9ce🏾\\u200d♂️\\n9/29/20, 7:38 PM - +234 706 291 3214: Wow, well understood sir\\n9/29/20, 7:38 PM - +234 701 795 5647: Yes sir\\n9/29/20, 7:45 PM - +91 86073 10953 joined using this group\\'s invite link\\n9/29/20, 7:40 PM - Prosper Ubong: <Media omitted>\\n9/29/20, 7:41 PM - Prosper Ubong: Ok we move\\n9/29/20, 8:09 PM - +234 812 755 2328 joined using this group\\'s invite link\\n9/29/20, 7:44 PM - Prosper Ubong: *EFFECT of HEAT on MATTER*\\nMention them and if u can explain\\n9/29/20, 7:44 PM - +234 706 291 3214: Yes sir\\n9/29/20, 7:44 PM - +234 812 387 4992: Change of state\\n9/29/20, 7:44 PM - +234 701 742 5997: Change in temperature\\n9/29/20, 7:45 PM - +234 706 291 3214: Heat causes expansion\\n9/29/20, 7:45 PM - +234 701 742 5997: Change in pressure\\n9/29/20, 7:45 PM - Prosper Ubong: More\\n9/29/20, 7:46 PM - +234 701 795 5647: Increase in temperature\\n9/29/20, 7:46 PM - +234 701 795 5647: Change of state\\n9/29/20, 7:46 PM - Prosper Ubong: Ok\\n9/29/20, 7:47 PM - Prosper Ubong: I hope we all understand how that works\\n9/29/20, 7:48 PM - +234 701 742 5997: Expansion of solid\\n9/29/20, 7:48 PM - +234 701 742 5997: Change in physical property\\nChemical changes\\nThermionic expansion\\n9/29/20, 7:48 PM - +234 816 941 3904: Heat is an energy that causes increase in temperature or Chand in state while temperature is only a scale or term for the degree of hotness or coldNess of a body\\n9/29/20, 7:50 PM - Prosper Ubong: *One effect of heat on matter that I will like us to deliberate on is change in Physical property.❗❗❗*\\n\\n\\nCan someone mention one Physical property and state how heat affect such property?\\n🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽\\n9/29/20, 7:51 PM - +234 701 742 5997: This message was deleted\\n9/29/20, 7:55 PM - Prosper Ubong: Ok lemme give you idea\\n9/29/20, 7:55 PM - +234 706 291 3214: Good sir\\n9/29/20, 7:56 PM - +234 701 742 5997: Niceee\\n9/29/20, 7:56 PM - Prosper Ubong: Explain how heat affect the following Physical properties \\n1.

in the school of glory...\\n\\nDecision separates men...\\nThere is an OIL that comes with separation...\\nThe weight of a man is buried in the decisions he makes when no one is watching him ...\\n\\nMany times, God allows you to be lonely so that you can be holy...\\n\\nForget this public revival messages all of us are preaching...\\nMany are still behind in the school of glory...\\n\\nNot because they chose to, but because they still don\\'t want to pay the price of separation...\\n\\nIf it takes a man to be married to be responsible, we will not have many married irresponsible men scattered all over the place who are renting houses for their girlfriends, while their wives are still at home....\\n\\nWhen a man is due for marriage, he should get married...\\n\\nBut don\\'t tell me to get married because you want me to escape fornication...\\nMarriage is not an escape route into a responsible life... \\n\\nWhat you cannot control when you are single has the power to control you even when you are married ...\\n\\nNo matter how beautiful your wife will be, you will still see other beautiful ladies....\\nTeach me how to die to flesh sir...\\nTeach me that I can live alone in a house alone and yet, I will not think rubbish thoughts...\\n\\nJoseph was not married before he ran away naked from Portiphar\\'s wife bedroom ...\\nIt was not a marital ring on his finger that made him refuse that gesture....\\n\\nBut because he knew the future God has planned for Him will be messed up by a single decision....\\n\\nGod wants to raise a generation of young boys and girls that will love God where no one is seeing them ...\\n\\nGod wants to raise a breed that doesn\\'t appear holy only when they see their parents or their pastors... \\n\\nThis holiness by dressing is sending people from choir seats to hell fire...\\nThey are dying in secret sins, yet, they have none to cry to, because, once they confess, they will be stigmatized...\\n\\nConsequently, we are raising a generation that is speaking in tongues on their way to hell...\\n\\nSister, singing in choir doesn\\'t confer value on men before God, but decision...\\nStop attaching your spiritual growth on night vigils where you go and flog enemies ...\\n\\nGod is waiting for you when no one is there...\\nIf you can succeed there, you will be a commander of the supernatural...\\n\\nThe greatest tool against the end time church is the adulteration of the message of grace...\\nThey teach you that God will forgive...\\nBut they will not teach you that God will not promote you to another class...\\n\\nNo matter how you love your child, you will not give him your car key to use when you know he has not perfected his driving...\\n\\nAs long as that child is finding it hard to drive perfectly, he will keep trekking to school...\\n\\nThere is someone reading this posts now, heaven is saying that you are due for manifestation, but you have not made a decision yet...\\n\\nYou are still afraid of hunger....\\nYou don\\'t want to starve....\\nYou are ashamed of what people will say when you stop sleeping with men for money to pay bills...\\n\\nThey have even told you that there is no young person like you that doesn\\'t have sexual partners...\\nThat human beings were wired by God to fall and rise again...\\n\\nSeveral times, you have made moves to delete all those phone numbers that connect you to your vomits...\\nBut you have been afraid of the days of loneliness...\\n\\nYou don\\'t want to miss those cuddles...\\nYou don\\'t know if you can ever look into his eyes and tell him: \"No more sex\"...\\n\\nEven if he accepts, you are afraid that you might never cope...\\n\\nSister, don\\'t let weekend orgasm rob you of eternal value...\\n\\nYour enemy is no more that witch in the village.... \\n\\nBut any man that is making you comfortable in a place of rebellion with God ...\\n\\nDon\\'t be in church singing in the choir and God will go to the nearest hotel and catch a prostitute, wash her, clean her and fill her with His power...\\n\\nI know you have been trying to make amends ...\\nYou have answered altar calls several times, yet, you still fall back, even more deeper ...\\n\\nSome of us were there not too long ago...\\nSinging in choir, leading in powerful prayer sections, yet, battling with addictions...\\n\\nWorse of all we were afraid to tell anyone...\\nBecause, people around would never have understood how much we were trying to be better ... \\n\\nWe bought different anointing oil, from different men of God, yet, we were not free...\\nWe even afflicted ourselves with fastings...\\nYet, nothing changed ...\\n\\nUntil we encountered the Word of God.....\\nWhen Jesus said that \" We are made clean by the Words that I speak unto you...\"\\n\\nWe began to read and study the Bible...\\nLike Job, we began to esteem God\\'s Word above our necessary food...\\n\\nGradually, addictions began to lose its grip...\\nGod began to change our appetites...\\nUntil today, the darkness is past, the true Light now shineth ...\\n\\nBrother, I want to recommend you to the Word of God....\\nThe Word of God will settle that lust issue...\\nDon\\'t go and rush into marriage if you are not ready, because you want to avoid temptation...\\n\\nThe spirit of lust does not respect wedding ring...\\n\\nEspecially now that our sisters who are still in Babylon even prefer having it with married men ...\\n\\nThere are still single guys who are serving God in spirit and in truth...\\n5 chapters of the bible every day and 1 hour prayers or more...\\n\\nYou will see that your mind will stop going to those thoughts ...\\nJesus did not say it is easy...\\nBut He said that with God all things are possible ...\\n\\nYour heart is beating faster now as you are reading this...\\nYou are wondering if you will ever get free from the things you are struggling with...\\n\\nFriend, that God that did it for us, He will show up on your case...\\n\\nReceive grace to feast on the Word from now....\\nIn Jesus Name...please teach the young ones in your church and God bless you. \\n\\nThere is no obligation to share. No whips or curses if you don\\'t share. But we both know that when you share this, it goes a long way to help someone.\\n\\nSo I\\'m asking you to help  someone\\n( God is counting on us to represent Him well )\\n#HungryForTrueRevival#\\n10/6/20, 7:13 AM - +234 909 393 4248: God revive my soul 🔥🔥🔥🔥\\n10/6/20, 7:14 AM - AjalaJohnMEE: Hmm... sorry 🙏🙇\\u200d♂️\\n A little adjustment.

And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded\" (2 CHRONICLES 35:22,23)._\\n\\nAll men without grace are prone to disobeying God. As many refuse to heed the admonition to watch what they eat and drink; even so is it the creed of man to wantonly disobey God\\'s laws and commandments. This they do to their own peril.\\n\\nJosiah became king at the age of eight. He started very well and at age 15, began to seek the God of David. At 19, he started the reform that destroyed idols in the land. At 25, he began to rebuild the temple that was left desolate in the previous decades of idol worship. While the temple was being cleaned, the Book of the Law was found. On reading it, he saw the anger of the Lord against Judah for forsaking Him and going after strange gods. He repented and called the people to repentance. There was a restoration of true worship and the start of the last revival in Judah before the captivity.\\n\\nOur text today shows the danger of disobedience to the word of God even in time of revival and seeming prosperity. In the 31st year of Josiah\\'s reign, the king of Egypt was going to war against the king of Assyria by Euphrates River and sent emissary to Josiah for permission to pass through the land of Judah; Josiah refused even when he was told that it was at the command of the Lord. To be able to fight this unnecessary battle, he disguised himself and was wounded in the encounter. He died at the hand of an enemy.\\n\\nThe sad end of King Josiah should serve as a lesson to present day believers. If a righteous man engages in an unrighteous cause, he should not expect to prosper. God is no respecter of persons. Whenever you are confused of what decision to take, consult Him. In minor, medium and major events, never fail to seek His counsel.\\n\\n*✍THOUGHT FOR THE DAY* Disobedience begets God\\'s indignation. Beware!\\n\\n*BIBLE IN ONE YEAR* ISAIAH 18-21.\\n\\n*MEDITATION*\\n\\nHow the righteous can die the death of the unrighteous\\n\\n1. Josiah, no doubt, was a righteous king,  revivalist and restorer of the true worship of God. What a great achievement, vv17-19.\\n2. His *perceived enemy*, king of Egypt, warned him that his war was against Assyria and therefore, Josiah should not meddle with that fight, v21.\\n3. Josiah had the option of seeking the face of God or even ask Jeremiah to confirm whether what the king of Egypt was saying was truth or not. He did not use that option, v25.\\n4. Josiah did not bother to take counsel from spiritual high priest and the prophetess Huldah who God used to assist him in bringing revival to Israel and to show him the mind of God before this time, 34:18-22. He was a lone ranger at this time, going for national warfare without consulting any, including God.\\n5. Like the wicked Ahab the king, he resorted to deception by disguising himself in battle, 35:22.\\n6. He eventually died the death of the King of Assyria who was the prime target of the king of Egypt.\\n7. Yes, he died the death which was not meant for him. *Why*\\na. Presumption. Taking God for granted.\\nb. Fighting a perceived enemy who is stronger without divine direction. \\nc. Ignoring the counsel and ministry of spiritual and gifted people like Jeremiah and Huldah in times of uncertainties and warfare.\\nd. Allowing pride of achievements, and stubbornness, which make manipulation and hardness of heart very easy.\\n8.

If we put Christ in the middle of our life (Birth--->Christ--->Death) our life will not end at D but extend to E.\\n\\nWhat is E? It\\'s Eternal Life. So all those who put Christ in the middle of their life have Eternal life after Death, but those who do not put Christ in the middle of their lives don\\'t have Eternal life after Death but they have F(Fire).\\n\\nTherefore the Mathematical Equation or Definition of Life For Christians is B + C +  D=E\\n\\nBirth + Christ + Death = Eternal Life And the Mathematical Equation or Definition Of Life For Unbelievers is B - C + D= F.\\nThat is Birth - Christ + Death = Fire.\\n\\nThere\\'s always blessing in sharing.... so share with others. He that wins a soul is wise!!!
